# Wharton Research Data Services GitHub Organization

This is our home on GitHub. Here are brief instructions on how to join:

* Make sure you already have a GitHub account. You can use your personal account; authenticating with PennKey will make your account a members of the WRDS organization.
* All members of the upenn GitHub organization are required to have two-factor authentication enabled on their GitHub accounts. If you have not done so already, see these instructions:

## Configuring two-factor authentication

After logging into your GitHub account (with two-factor authentication enabled), visit this URL to authenticate with your PennKey and automatically become a member of the upenn GitHub organization:

https://github.com/orgs/wrds/sso/sign_up

Note that you can associate your Penn WebLogin SSO identity with any of your GitHub accounts, but only one can be associated at a time. You will also be required to enable Two-factor authentication on your GitHub account, if you havenâ€™t done so already.
